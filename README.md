# slidedisplay

A simple slidedisplay that loops through images in a folder

## Usage

 - Deploy these three files somewhere
 - Put images into `img` directory
 - Adjust path in the first line of `script.js`
 - Enjoy!

## Additional features
If your display machine is powerful enough (i.e. everything better than a raspi zero or raspi 2), you can enable crossfading between images by enabling the commented line in `style.css`
